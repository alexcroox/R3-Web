Website component for the [game server side addon](https://github.com/alexcroox/R3) for capturing unit movement and behaviour to a database for After Action Replays online.

No modifications to your missions required, nothing for clients to download.

Being built along side the [addon component](https://github.com/alexcroox/R3) and [automated tiler](https://titanmods.xyz/r3/tiler)

### Demo

An exact mirror of this repo [can be viewed here](https://titanmods.xyz/r3/ark/) which contains replays from [ARK Group](http://ark-group.org/)

### Install

**_Note:_ R3 is currently undergoing a big v1 data storage refactor, and will not support historical data generated by the current version, [read more](https://github.com/alexcroox/R3-Web/issues/14)**

1. Follow the step by step [instructions on the addon repo](https://github.com/alexcroox/R3) and ensure you have mission event data in your database
2. Download the [latest web release](https://github.com/alexcroox/R3-Web/releases/latest)
3. Rename `config.template.php` to `config.php`, pay close attention to `DB_*`, `WEB_PATH` and timezone configurations
4. Upload the files to your web server which matches the URL in `WEB_PATH` in `config.php`. Take note of `/.htaccess` in the download that may be hidden on your system before you upload.

### Adding new Terrains

R3 supports over [70 popular terrains](https://titanmods.xyz/r3/tiler). Just played a mission on a map that R3 doesn't yet support? Feel free to add it yourself and let every user of R3 benefit from it! Follow the [simple instructions here](https://github.com/alexcroox/R3-Web/wiki/Adding-new-terrains)

### Adding new vehicle icons

Is a modded vehicle using the vanilla map icon instead of the correct shape and outline for that mod? [Submit new vehicle icons here](https://titanmods.xyz/r3/tiler/icons), and every user of R3 will get access to it! Follow the [simple instructions here](https://github.com/alexcroox/R3-Web/wiki/Adding-new-icons)

### Getting help

You can find me (Titan) on [ACE3 Slack](https://slackin.ace3mod.com/) or feel free to create an issue here.

### Why not x framework/language

In an ideal world I'd be using web sockets and node to stream from the game server straight to a flat json file, and to the browser. 
However the goal is to allow Arma 3 server admins to be able to run this and contribute. PHP + MySQL is the most common setup these administrators (with potentially limited sysadmin knowledge or sudo access) will have so it is the correct choice, as limiting as that can be!
